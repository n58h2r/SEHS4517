Assignment 
Individual Assignment (30% of the assessment of this course) 
This individual assignment aims: 
 To conduct research on relevant reference materials or sources. 
To develop an interactive web application using HTML5 and PHP. 
 
Scenario: 
Choose an organization that requires member registration. Examples of this organization include a 
soccer fan club, fitness club, dance group, music group, professional organization, charity, … The 
Chairman of this organization wants you to develop ONE web page with the filename 
welcome.html that contains an introduction for the organization. The introduction should NOT 
exceed 600 words. That web page also contains an online registration form for the potential 
members to join that organization. The online registration form contains the following fields for a 
user to input: 
 
The registration form contains one button labelled with “Register” for sending the user input by 
POST method to the CGI program called member.php. The registration form also contains a button 
labelled with “Clear” to reset the user input. You can have your own design for these buttons and 
the registration form by adding colors, background and pictures only. (Note: NO videos and NO 
audios are allowed). 
 
You are also requested to develop TWO web server programs that process the user input from the 
registration form. Once the user presses the “Register” button on the registration form you have 
made, the user input will be sent to a web server program called member.php which will generate a 
web page that shows the user input. You will design how the user input information is displayed on 
this newly generated web page. 
 
This newly generated web page contains two buttons. You can have your own design of these 
buttons. One button is labelled with “Back” which is used for the user to press to go back to the web 
page showing the registration form you have made and allows the user to re-enter the particulars on Page 2 of 4 
the registration form. The other button is labelled with “Confirm” which is used to confirm the user 
input. Once the “Confirm” button is pressed, another web server program called check.php will be 
activated to check if the user’s input age is larger than or equal to 18 years of age. 
 
If the user’s input age is larger than or equal to 18 years of age, then the web server program will 
generate a “thank you” web page. The message on the “thank you” web page is created by you and 
should NOT exceed 50 words. You can have your own design of this “thank you” web page. 
 
If the user’s input age is less than 18 years of age, then the web server program will generate a 
“sorry” web page, telling the user that the user is too young to be a member and is not allowed to be 
the member. The message on the “sorry” web page is created by you and should NOT exceed 50 
words. You can have your own design of this “sorry” web page. 
 
Requirements: 
 Use HTML5 that follows XHTML syntax rules to design the web page containing the 
registration form. The filename for this web page is welcome.html. 
 Use PHP to develop the web server programs member.php and check.php that process the user 
input from the registration form. 
 You can use pictures for this assignment, but NO videos and NO audios are allowed in 代 写SEHS4517、Java/C++

 At the beginning of your source codes (i.e., HTML5 and PHP), there are comments stating the 
following: 
 This subject information (i.e. SEHS3245 Web Systems and Technologies) 
 This assignment information (i.e., Individual Assignment) 
 Submission date (i.e., 12 October 2024) 
 Your full name 
 Your student ID number 
 
Submission: 
1. From each student, put your web page source code (i.e., HTML tags), PHP programs and your 
web page design (screen capture is fine. Screen capture can be carried out by holding down 
ALT key, then pressing Print Sc key, then paste into a document) into a Microsoft Word 2016 
document. Convert the Microsoft Word 2016 document to PDF format by choosing File, then 
Print, then under Printer, choose Microsoft Print to PDF, click OK. Change the filename to be 
A appended with your full name and your student ID number. If your name is Chan Tai Man 
and your student ID number is 24012345S, then the filename is 
A_ChanTaiMan_24012345S.pdf. Page 3 of 4 
 
2. Put the .pdf file, the .html file, the .php files and picture files (if any) into a folder. Make a zip 
file of the folder containing all your work: 
o Click on the folder and go outside of the folder where your work is saved 
o Right-click on the folder that contains all your work, then, depending on your computer, 
do EITHER of the following: 
 Select 7-Zip then select the second-last option Add to “project.zip” (assuming that 
you are in a folder called project) 
 Select Send-to and then Compressed (zipped) folder 
o New .zip file should be created. 
o Note: 7-zip is a freeware downloadable through the Internet. 
3. Right-click on this .zip file, then select Rename, then change the name to A appended with your 
full name and student ID number. If your name is Chan Tai Man and your student ID number is 
24012345S, then the filename should be A_ChanTaiMan_24012345S.zip 
4. Submit the .zip file to Blackboard by 10PM, 12 October 2024 (Saturday). 
 
While submitting the softcopy via Blackboard, a timestamp will be placed on the softcopy of your 
assignment. There is a sharp cut-off time at Blackboard, so late submission will be recorded at 
Blackboard. Softcopy submitted via email or other means will NOT be accepted unless Blackboard 
is not available. As many students will submit their assignments to Blackboard at around the Page 4 of 4 
deadline time, it normally takes longer for uploading your assignment. So, it is strongly suggested 
that you start submitting earlier, say at least 45 minutes before the deadline. Marks will be deducted 
for late submission. Successful submission of this assignment includes the submission of all items 
specified in this section. 
 
Marking Scheme: 
Design 50% and Content 50% 
 
The content of the web page will be marked. The design of the web page using the knowledge 
you have learned in this subject will also be marked, Use of graphics, background and 
highlighting effect will be marked but DO NOT include any video or audio effect to the web 
page. Use of hyperlinks to provide a convenient way to navigate around different sections in 
the web page will be marked. 
 
Plagiarism will be penalized severely. Marks will be deducted for assignments that are 
plagiarized in whole or in part, regardless of the sources. 
 
 Mark deduction items include spelling mistakes, poor writing style, copy and paste directly 
from any web resources, etc.
